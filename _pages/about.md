# Short Bio
Currently, I am looking for full time employment in Data Scientist and ML engineering roles. Throughout my Ph.D., I worked closely with data: doing multiparticle simulations of electron beams and tracking their real space and momentum space coordinates of up to 10000 particles, or analyzing time-series electron diffraction images. These projects involve Data Extraction, Data Cleaning, and Data Manipulation of large data sets (few Gb) and fitting them into theoretical models. I have been coding in Python for 10+ years and taught it for undergraduate courses. I am also knowledgeable in SQL, Tableau, and Excel. In addition to those technical skills I mentioned, I am very comfortable presenting my work to a technical and lay audience, and I have lots of experience writing technical reports. 

In addition to my professional expertise, I am passionate about martial arts, with a focus on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (currently holding a purple belt) and Muay Thai. I relish the adventure of embarking on extended backcountry canoe camping trips during the summer months. While the pandemic left me with ample time at home, I found a new interest in woodworking, which allowed me to explore my creativity. I take great pleasure in working with my hands, be it crafting something from scratch or tackling repairs in the laboratory during my Ph.D. studies or at home.
