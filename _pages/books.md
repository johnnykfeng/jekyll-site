# Most influential books I've read
These books have shaped me into the person I am now. The ordering isn't too important, I just listed them in the ordered that I can remember them. And of course, I've read way more books than this list.

1. [**Deep Work** by Cal Newport](https://www.amazon.ca/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1680556017&sr=8-1)<br>
   * **Influence on me:** This is a must read for knowledge workers, especially anything that involves complex problem solving or creative work. Put the phone down, and embrace deep work. 

2. [**Outliers** by Malcolm Gladwell](https://www.amazon.ca/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength/dp/1594203075/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1680556307&sr=8-1)
   * **Influence on me:** This was the first non-fiction book that I truly loved, I read it in my first-year undergrad. At the time I was a struggling university student and varsity athlete. The notion that success is rarely an individual effort, but a product of one's environment, changed the way I view achievement. I large component of success is luck, so don't feel bad your not a millionare yet. On the other hand, the 10,000 hour rule suggest that mastery is in any difficult pursuit is achievable in 10 years, so something to be optimistic about.

3. [**Willpower** by Roy Baumeister](https://www.amazon.ca/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength/dp/1594203075/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1680556307&sr=8-1)
   * **Influence on me:** Baumeister provides scientific rigor in answer questions about willpower such as: is willpower limited? how to increase willpower? I found this book very interesting, and especially salient during a difficult time in my life. I especially appreciate how the other just reports the findings of research studies, rather than be a shameless self-help book

4. [**Atomic Habits** by James Clear](https://www.amazon.ca/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength/dp/1594203075/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1680556307&sr=8-1)
   * **Influence on me:** Real self-improvements happens by changing your habits. This book gives great advice on just that. All your faults and bad habits can't be changed overnight, there's a strategic approach to it. 
  
5. [**Principles** by Ray Dalio](https://www.amazon.ca/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength/dp/1594203075/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1680556307&sr=8-1)
   * **Influence on me:** The biggest thing I took from this book is radical honesty is essential for profession growth. Another one is Pain + Reflection = Progress.

6. [**How to win friends and influence people** by Dale Carnegie](https://www.amazon.ca/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength/dp/1594203075/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1680556307&sr=8-1)
   * **Influence on me:** During my PhD, I realize how important it was to work well with people. It is not enough to be a lone superstar that can do everything himself. This book has great principles and anecdotes on how to get the most out of people, especially in difficult situations.  

7. [**Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman** by Richard Feynman](https://www.amazon.ca/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength/dp/1594203075/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1680556307&sr=8-1)
   * **Influence on me:**

   * **Influence on me:** 

9. [**Essentialism** by Greg Mckeown](https://www.amazon.ca/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength/dp/1594203075/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1680556307&sr=8-1)
